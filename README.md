# **OscillatorOptimization.jl: Optimization of Oscillatory Systems Using Evolutionary Algorithms**

## **Overview**

> **Note for AI agents:** For current development status, progress tracking, and known issues, see [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md).

This package implements a custom Quality Diversity (QD) evolutionary algorithm to optimize oscillatory biological systems modeled with differential equations. The project supports two main models: a lipid oscillator system and a coupled trimer assembly system. The goal is to find parameter sets that produce desired oscillatory behavior in systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The codebase integrates with the [Evolutionary.jl](https://github.com/wildart/Evolutionary.jl) framework, uses trait-based dispatch for model-agnostic optimization, and leverages Julia's capabilities for high-performance numerical computing.

## **Getting Started**

## **Code Structure**

The codebase is organized into several modules, each handling different aspects of the optimization process. Below is a detailed explanation of each component.

### **1. Reaction System Model Definition**

**Files:** `full_model.jl`, `trimer_model.jl`

**Purpose:**

- Defines biochemical oscillator models as `ReactionSystem` objects using Catalyst.jl, which allows for easy construction of chemical reaction networks.
- Specifies the components of the reaction systems, including rate constants, dimensionality factors (DF), species, and initial conditions.
- **Lipid Oscillator Models** (`full_model.jl`):
  - `base_rn`: 12-variable restricted model with essential complexes
  - `peripheral_rn`: Additional peripheral reactions
  - `fullrn`: Complete reaction network extending `base_rn` with `peripheral_rn`
- **Trimer Assembly Model** (`trimer_model.jl`):
  - `trimer_rn`: Extended model with heterotrimer assembly on membrane
  - Includes monomer species (B, C, D) and assembly intermediates
  - Models pathway from monomers → dimers → trimers with membrane localization

**Key Components:**

- **Lipid Models**: `base_rn`, `peripheral_rn`, `fullrn` with observables `Amem_old`, `Amem`
- **Trimer Model**: `trimer_rn` with observables `Amem_old`, `TrimerYield`, `Tmem`
- **make_odeprob/make_trimer_odeprob**: Functions that convert reaction networks into `ODEProblem` objects

**Workflow Integration:**

- Models are converted to `ODESystem` objects which form the basis for optimization. Parameters and species initial conditions are tunable, enabling evolutionary search for oscillatory behavior. The trait system automatically selects appropriate observables for each model type.

### **2. Accessor Functions for Reaction System**

**File:** `accessor_functions.jl`

**Purpose:**

- Provides utility functions to access and manipulate the symbolic properties of `ReactionSystem` objects.

**Workflow Integration:**

- These functions are used throughout the optimization process to access and manipulate the properties of reaction systems dynamically, especially during population initialization and evaluation. They work seamlessly with both model types through the shared parameter structure.

### **3. Trait-Based Dispatch System**

**File:** `traits.jl`

**Purpose:**

- Implements a trait-based dispatch system for model-agnostic optimization.

   - **Trait system automatically selects** appropriate fitness observables for the model type.
   - Set up the initial population with parameters and species initial conditions.

2. **Evaluation:**

   - For each individual, `evaluate_individual!` solves the ODEs and calculates the fitness using `calculate_fitness!`.

   - Unique individuals are extracted, and results are compiled into a `DataFrame`.

6. **Analysis:**

   - The results can be analyzed and visualized to interpret the optimization outcomes.

## **Usage**

1. **Set Up the ODE Model:**

   - Define your ODE system (choose from `fullrn`, `trimer_rn`, or define your own).
   - Create an `OptimizationReactionSystem` instance - **traits automatically handle observable selection**.
   - **For new models:** Implement the `fitness_observables(::Val{:your_model_name})` trait method.

2. **Configure the Optimization:**

   - Initialize the `QD` struct with desired algorithm parameters.
   - Set up the initial population.

3. **Run the Optimization:**

   ```julia
   # Load the package (includes commonly used functions from dependencies)
   using OscillatorOptimization

   # Import additional solvers if needed (Rodas5P is commonly used for stiff problems)
   using OrdinaryDiffEq: Rodas5P

   # Set BLAS threads to 1 to avoid multithreading issues
   BLAS.set_num_threads(1)

   # Define fixed parameters
   fixed_params = Dict(:DF => 100.0)

   # Define ODE solver algorithm
   alg = Rodas5P(chunk_size = 16)
   # Define optimization system for lipid oscillator model
   fixed_opt_sys = OptimizationReactionSystem(fullrn, alg; fixed_params)

   # Run optimization
   fixed_results = run_optimization(1000, fixed_opt_sys; mutation_δ = 1.0, pm = 0.75, η = 1, n_points = Inf, num_tournament_groups = 20,  mutationRate = 0.95, crossoverRate = 0.75, sbx_pm = 0.3, sbx_η = 2, parallelization = :threadprogress, callback = nothing, show_trace = true)

   # Access results dataframe and save to disk
   results_df = fixed_results.results_df
   write("optimization_results.csv", results_df)

   # Alternative: Use trimer assembly model
   # trimer_opt_sys = OptimizationReactionSystem(trimer_rn, alg; fixed_params)
   # trimer_results = run_optimization(1000, trimer_opt_sys; <same parameters>)
   ```

   **Note:** You can use different ODE solvers by importing them from `OrdinaryDiffEq`. For example:
   ```julia
   using OrdinaryDiffEq: Tsit5, Rosenbrock23, Vern9
   
   # For non-stiff problems
   alg = Tsit5()
   
   # For stiff problems (alternative to Rodas5P)
   alg = Rosenbrock23()
   
   # For high accuracy
   alg = Vern9()
   ```


4. **Analyze Results:**

   - If instead you want to re-solve for an existing solution from a `DataFrame` dataset, you can use the `solve_row` method.

   ```julia
   # Load the package (includes commonly used functions from dependencies)
   using OscillatorOptimization

   # Set BLAS threads to 1 to avoid multithreading issues
   BLAS.set_num_threads(1)

   # Load the results dataframe
   results_df = read("optimization_results.csv", DataFrame)

   # Solve the first row, returns an `ODESolution` object
   sol = solve_row(results_df[1, :], fullrn)

   # Plot the solution with desired observables/species
   plot(sol, idxs = [:Amem_old, :Amem])

   # Or extract individual solutions as Vectors 
   amem = sol[:Amem]
   L = sol[:L]
   K = sol[:K]
   P = sol[:P]
   LpA = sol[:LpA]
   ```

   **For High-Throughput Analysis:** If you need to solve many rows from the same `DataFrame` efficiently, use the performant version that returns a solver function. This is useful for loops or parallel processing.

   ```julia
   # Create a performant solver function (one-time setup)
   fast_solver = solve_row(results_df, fullrn)

   # Now solve any row efficiently
   sol1 = fast_solver(1)      # Solve first row
   sol42 = fast_solver(42)    # Solve 42nd row
   sol1000 = fast_solver(1000) # Solve 1000th row

   # Perfect for loops or parallel processing
   solutions = [fast_solver(i) for i in 1:100]  # Solve first 100 rows
   
   # Or for specific analysis
   interesting_rows = [1, 42, 100, 500, 1000]
   interesting_solutions = [fast_solver(i) for i in interesting_rows]
   ```

   **Performance Benefits:**
   - **One-time setup cost**: Column extraction and setter creation happens once
   - **Fast repeated solves**: Uses pre-extracted matrices and SymbolicIndexingInterface
   - **Thread-safe**: Each call creates isolated problem copies
   - **Memory efficient**: Uses `view()` for zero-copy matrix access

   **When to Use Each Method:**
   - **`solve_row(row, odeprob)`**: For interactive use, single solves, or when you have individual rows
   - **`solve_row(df, odeprob)`**: For high-throughput workflows, loops, or when you need to solve many rows from the same DataFrame
