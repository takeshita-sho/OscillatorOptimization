# Development Status & Progress Tracking

## 📋 Current Status (August 2025)

**✅ Recently Completed**
- ✅ **Fixed circular dependency issues**: Resolved `AbstractNonlinearTerminationMode` errors from Symbolics ecosystem by removing restrictive compat bounds
- ✅ **Fixed duplicate parameter bug**: Removed duplicate `DF` parameter in `trimer_model.jl` (lines 17 and 38)
- ✅ **Corrected CI configuration**: Updated GitHub Actions workflow to use Manifest.toml instead of problematic package pinning
- ✅ **Package precompilation**: Successfully loads and precompiles on Julia 1.10
- ✅ **Added fitness function tests**: Unit tests now validate exact fitness values (0.520, 49.2, 0.630) from known oscillatory solution
- ✅ **Dependency cleanup**: Removed unused LaTeXStrings dependency and plotting_utils.jl file
- ✅ **Documentation updates**: Updated thesis appendices to reflect new package name "OscillatorOptimization" instead of "OscTools"

## 🎯 Current Objectives

**High Priority**
- 🔄 **CI validation**: Verifying GitHub Actions work with new Manifest.toml approach (focusing on Julia 1.10)
- 📦 **Dependency optimization**: Investigating potentially redundant dependencies:
  - `ADTypes` - likely re-exported by ModelingToolkit
  - `SymbolicIndexingInterface` - likely re-exported by ModelingToolkit
  - Other utility packages that could be moved to extensions (CSV, PrettyTables, Term, etc.)

**Medium Priority**  
- 🧪 **Model validation**: Comprehensive testing of trimer assembly and lipid oscillator models
- 📊 **Performance benchmarking**: Validate optimization performance matches expectations
- 🔧 **API stability**: Finalize public API before potential package registration

**Future Considerations**
- 📚 **Package registration**: Consider registering in Julia General registry once stable
- 🚀 **Extension system**: Move optional dependencies (plotting, I/O utilities) to package extensions
- 📖 **Documentation**: Add more comprehensive examples and tutorials

## ⚠️ Known Issues

**Active Issues**
- ❌ **Julia 1.11 compatibility**: Expected to have precompilation issues due to SciML ecosystem immaturity on Julia 1.11
- ⚠️ **Circular dependency warnings**: Symbolics extensions still show warnings but don't block functionality

**Resolved Issues** 
- ✅ `AbstractNonlinearTerminationMode` circular dependency (fixed by removing compat bounds)
- ✅ Duplicate `DF` parameter in trimer model (fixed by removing duplicate declaration)  
- ✅ CI package version conflicts (fixed by using Manifest.toml instead of explicit pinning)
